# TicTacToe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java. The game features a 3x3 game board and two players who take turns marking cells with their respective markers ('X' or 'O'). The game ends when one player wins by marking three cells in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells on the board are filled without either player winning (resulting in a tie).

Getting Started

To run the game, simply clone the repository and run the Main class in your IDE. Alternatively, you can compile the code manually and run the compiled Main class using the command line.

How to Play

The game is played by two players who take turns marking cells on the game board with their respective markers ('X' or 'O'). To make a move, a player must enter the row and column indices of the cell they wish to mark (0-2). The game board is displayed in the console after each move, so players can see the current state of the game.

The game ends when one player wins by marking three cells in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells on the board are filled without either player winning (resulting in a tie).

Customization

You can customize the player names and markers in the Main class to suit your preferences. You can also modify the game board size or add additional features such as a menu, difficulty levels, or game statistics.
